# Preferences and keyboard shortcuts

The Preferences menu can be accessed from the main panel's `hamburger menu > Preferencesâ€¦`

Penpal is localized into Chinese, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish languages. Select your preferred language in the dropdown.

You can adjust the next three settings by clicking on the sliders or clicking the numbers to their right. However, these settings can also be adjusted on the fly using keyboard shortcuts, without opening the preferences window at all, by using the `-` and `+` keys, with modifiers, _whilst Penpal is the active panel_ in After Effects - see below for details.

**Handle Size** determines the size, in pixels, that point and tangent indicators (squares and circles) display in the panel. On high-DPI screens you may find that even numbers work better than odd.

You can also adjust handle size with the `+` and `-` keys, without any modifier keys.

**Canvas margin** sets the width of the border around all the paths displayed in the canvas. A wider margin can make it easier to drag selection marquees.

You can also adjust canvas margin with the `+` and `-` keys by also holding `Alt`.

**Directional arrow position** simply offsets the position of the small, elongated arrow that shows you the direction and first vertex of each path.

You can also adjust directional arrow position with the `+` and `-` keys, by also holding `Shift`.

**Show all tangents of open paths** - With an open path, the in tangent of the first point and the out tangent of the last point have no effect on the appearance of the path. If you deal with a lot of open paths you may wish not to see those tangents.

**Show tooltips** can be used to disable the tooltip bar at the bottom of the canvas once you are familiar with all of Penpal's functions

**Contextual menu** You can disable the data options in the [context menu](context-menu.md) if you prefer.
