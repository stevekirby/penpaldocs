# Introduction

Penpal is an old extension for Adobe After Effects that enables additional editing capabilities for paths, points and tangents. It works with both shape layer paths and mask paths.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Points are sometimes called vertices, and tangents are sometimes called direction handles or direction lines. We always refer to them as points and tangents.

Throughout this guide we use the phrase `Cmd/Ctrl` to refer to the Command button if you're on a Mac, or the Control button if you have a Windows PC. When we refer to right-clicking, you can also use Ctrl-click if you're on a Mac
{% endhint %}

Penpal is compatible with After Effects CC2014 and later and can run in English, Chinese, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian or Spanish. It is a collaborative work between [renderTom](https://aescripts.com/authors/q-r/rendertom/) and [Steve Kirby](https://stevekirby.co.uk).

Download Penpal from [aescripts.com](https://aescripts.com/penpal/).

## Installation

Download and install the free [ZXP Installer](https://aescripts.com/learn/zxp-installer/) from aescripts.com. If you already have ZXP Installer we strongly suggest you `Check for Update…` to make sure you have the latest version.

Close After Effects if it is running. Open **ZXP Installer**, go to `File > Open`, then navigate to the **Penpal.zxp** file contained in your download, and install it.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you see an error message saying 'No application compatible with Penpal was found on your computer. Do you still want to try to install this extension?' - click on **Install**.
{% endhint %}

Open After Effects and go to the `Window > Extensions` menu, then click **Penpal**. If nothing happens, you may need to [follow these steps](faqs.md#when-i-click-on-window-greater-than-extensions-greater-than-penpal-nothing-happens).

You can dock the Penpal panel in your workspace, or use it floating if you prefer. It works nicely with the Tilde (\~) key that maximizes whichever panel your cursor is currently over. This method is ideal if you’re editing complex paths with lots of elements that appear crowded at smaller panel sizes.

## Licensing and trial mode

You can enter a license code for Penpal by going to the `hamburger menu > About & License…`&#x20;

Penpal has a free trial mode which will only load paths with 10 points or less, and functions for 10 days.
