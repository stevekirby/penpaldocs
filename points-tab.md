# Points tab



![](<.gitbook/assets/pointstab (1).png>)

#### <img src=".gitbook/assets/points - up.svg" alt="" data-size="line">Move up,<img src=".gitbook/assets/points - down.svg" alt="" data-size="line"> Move down, <img src=".gitbook/assets/points - left.svg" alt="" data-size="line">Move left, <img src=".gitbook/assets/points - right.svg" alt="" data-size="line">Move right

These buttons move selected points by 1px, or 10px if you hold `Shift`. If you hold `Alt` when you click them, the tangents that belong to the points will be 'left behind' instead of moved with the points.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Bear in mind that move, align, distribute and snap functions will behave parallel to the X and Y axes of whichever Space is active - composition, layer or shapes' parent group.
{% endhint %}

The next eight functions in the points tab all move points into a line, and correspond to typical Adobe **align and distribute** panels found in Creative Cloud applications.

#### <img src=".gitbook/assets/points - alignH.svg" alt="" data-size="line"> Align horizontal

This button will move all selected points into a line at their horizontal center.

#### <img src=".gitbook/assets/points - alignL.svg" alt="" data-size="line"> Align left

This button will move all selected points into a vertical line at the leftmost point.

#### <img src=".gitbook/assets/points - alignR.svg" alt="" data-size="line"> Align right

This button will move all selected points into a vertical line at the rightmost point.

#### <img src=".gitbook/assets/points - alignV.svg" alt="" data-size="line"> Align vertical

This button will move all selected points into a line at their vertical center.

#### <img src=".gitbook/assets/points - alignT.svg" alt="" data-size="line"> Align top

This button will move all selected points into a horizontal line at the topmost point.

#### <img src=".gitbook/assets/points - alignB.svg" alt="" data-size="line"> Align bottom

This button will move all selected points into a horizontal line at the bottommost point.

#### <img src=".gitbook/assets/points - distributeH.svg" alt="" data-size="line"> Distribute horizontally

This will distribute the selected points at even spaces between the leftmost and rightmost points. Requires at least three points to be selected.

#### <img src=".gitbook/assets/points - distributeV.svg" alt="" data-size="line"> Distribute vertically

This will distribute the selected points at even spaces between the topmost and bottommost points. Requires at least three points to be selected.

#### <img src=".gitbook/assets/points - mirrorX.svg" alt="" data-size="line"> Mirror points on the X axis, ![](<.gitbook/assets/points - mirrorY.svg>) Mirror points on the Y axis

The mirror buttons require an open path with either the first or last point selected. They will then mirror the shape, around that point, and join it at the other end.

#### <img src=".gitbook/assets/points - open (1).svg" alt="" data-size="line"> Toggle open / closed at selected points

You can use this button to quickly open a closed path between two points. Select two consecutive points, click the button, and the path will be opened at that segment.

{% hint style="info" %}
Unlike the similar button in the Paths tab, this button opens the path _between selected points_, instead of always doing so at the first vertex. Using this button can alter the first vertex.
{% endhint %}

If you select a path that is already open and click this button, it will simply be closed.

#### <img src=".gitbook/assets/points - split.svg" alt="" data-size="line"> Break path

This button can break one path into two or more separate paths. To do this, open paths require at least one point to be selected, closed paths require at least two. Penpal generates new path objects in your layer, next to your existing path, and disables the visibility of the old one.

If you select _only one point_ on a _closed_ path and click this button, it works a little differently. Instead of generating new paths, Penpal will split the path at the selected point, so that you have an open path which is the same length as the closed one but has one extra point. This is essentially the same as using the Scissors tool in Adobe Illustrator.

#### <img src=".gitbook/assets/points - setFirst.svg" alt="" data-size="line"> Set first vertex

This button is exactly the same as After Effectâ€™s native **Set First Vertex** operation, and will set the selected point to be the first vertex.

#### <img src=".gitbook/assets/points - snap.svg" alt="" data-size="line"> Snap

This button will force all selected points to shift so that they are located on the nearest multiple of a value. The default of 1 snaps them to whole pixel values, eg 1, 2, 3, 4 pixels. A value of 10 would shift them to the nearest multiple of 10 pixel values, eg 10, 20, 30, 40 pixels. This snapping is relative to the active Space, so it will only snap to the _actual composition pixels_ if you are using Comp space. Otherwise it is best thought of as snapping to pixel _values_ rather than pixels themselves.

If you hold `Alt` while you click the snap button, tangents of selected points will also be snapped.

#### <img src=".gitbook/assets/points - setSnap.svg" alt="" data-size="line"> Set Snap value

Change the value for pixel snapping. The value you enter is permanently stored, even after you restart After Effects.
